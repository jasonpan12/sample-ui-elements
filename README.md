# UI Elements + React
This app was created to demonstrate the simple developer experience for incorporating Box Platform into a React web app. A secondary goal was to see what could be done within an hour's time, from running `create-react-app` to final commit.

# Functionality Used
* create-react-app
* useState and useContext hooks
* [Box Platform](https://developer.box.com)
* [Box UI Elements](https://github.com/box/box-ui-elements)
* CSS with node-sass
